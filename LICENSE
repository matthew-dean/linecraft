SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-FLL-1.2

1. Purpose  
The Fair Labor License exists to ensure that free and open software does not contribute to extreme labor inequality. When organizations compensate their workers fairly, this software is free to use. When they do not, they must purchase a license — ensuring that value created through labor is not taken without accountability.

2. License Grant  
Subject to the conditions in this license, the author(s) grant permission to any individual or organization to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute this software.

3. Evaluation Use Exception  
Anyone may download, install, and use the software solely for evaluation and testing purposes. Evaluation use may not exceed 90 days and may not include operational, commercial, or production use.

4. Fair Compensation Condition (Eligibility for Free Use)  
This software is free to use for any individual or organization that meets at least one of the following conditions at the time of operational use:

a. Individuals  
The individual's net worth is under 5 million USD.

b. Organizations  
The organization is Fair Labor Compliant, defined as:
- The CEO’s (or highest-paid executive’s) total annual compensation is no more than fifteen (15) times the total annual compensation of the organization’s median employee, and  
- Eligibility is assessed on a consolidated basis, including all parent and subsidiary entities under common control or brand identity.

Definitions  
- “Total annual compensation” includes wages, bonuses, overtime, equity or stock-based compensation, and employer-provided benefits.  
- “Median employee” refers to the worker whose compensation is the exact midpoint of all workers, including part-time and contract labor when they constitute a majority of operational personnel.  
- “Operational use” means deployment or use of the software in any product, system, or service that provides business value, revenue, or ongoing internal operations beyond evaluation, whether used directly or indirectly, including when incorporated as a dependency or component of another product, system, or service.

5. Paid License Requirement  
If an individual or organization does not meet the Fair Compensation Condition at the time of operational use, they must obtain a paid license from the author(s) or an authorized licensing provider such as fllicense.org before such use begins.

Unauthorized operational use constitutes copyright infringement.

6. Self-Attestation and Documentation  
Licensees utilizing the software under the free-use provisions must self-attest compliance and maintain documentation supporting eligibility. Upon request by the author(s) or a licensing provider, documentation must be provided within 30 days.

Failure to provide documentation is considered a material breach of this license.

7. Change in Eligibility / Cure Period  
If a licensee’s eligibility changes, they must:
- Either purchase a paid license within 30 days, or  
- Immediately cease operational use of the software.

Restoring eligibility restores the rights granted under this license.

8. No Misrepresentation  
Licensees may not claim to be Fair Labor Compliant, nor use the Fair Labor License name or abbreviations in sales, marketing, or investor materials, unless they meet the Fair Compensation Condition.

9. No Warranty  
This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. Use is at your own risk.

10. Limitation of Liability  
In no event shall the author(s) be liable for any claim, damages, or liability arising from the software or its use.

11. Governing Law  
This license is governed by the copyright law applicable in the jurisdiction of the author(s).
